<h1 id="welcometojumbochat">Welcome to JumboChat!</h1>
<h2 id="whatitis">What it is</h2>

<p>JumboChat is an anonymous chat service just for people at Tufts University. When a chat session starts, you will be randomly paired with another person who also wants to chat. (These pairings aren&#8217;t <em>truly</em> random, they are just merely coincidental.) </p>

<p>In order to use JumboChat you must provide an email address that ends with &#8220;@tufts.edu&#8221;. This is merely for authentication purposes, and your email will not be associated with any chat sessions that you may have. In fact, any kind of personal information will not be displayed at any time.</p>

<h2 id="missionstatement">Mission Statement</h2>

<p>There are many anonymous chat services out there in the internet, and they work just fine! But it&#8217;s hard for two people from completely different places (both geographical and metaphysical) to talk about things of substance. JumboChat reduces the scope of anonymous chatting to a single university. We believe that this will create a <em>potential</em> for truly groundbreaking conversations. People will get the chance to talk about what they really feel or who they really are, without having to suffer any social consequences. </p>

<p>At JumboChat, we know that this service will also probably be used many people who are looking for conversations that are, <em>ahem</em>, not that groundbreaking, and that&#8217;s fine! JumboChat is here to help people express themselves in any way, shape, form, or direction. </p>

<p>We value free speech over everything else and abhor taboos of any kind.</p>
